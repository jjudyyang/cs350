Getting Started
---------------

Requirements:
 - SCons 4.0+
 - Clang 15
 - Qemu for simulation

IMPORTANT: Create a file called Local.sc in the base of the source tree that 
points to your Clang 15 binary.  Each OS distribution uses a different scheme 
but usually it is called clang15 or clang-15.  The file should contain the 
following two lines:

CC="path to clang-15"
LINK="path to clang-15"

To build the source code run:
# scons

To clean the source tree run:
# scons -c

Building on ARM64
-----------------

This release supports cross compiling from ARM64 machines provided that you 
still meet the above requirements.

If you are using macOS on Apple Silicon, beware that Apple's LLVM toolchain 
appears to be missing some of the linking bits necessary.  Please install LLVM 
from Mac Ports or your favorite package manager.

Building Documentation
----------------------

Requirements:
 - Doxygen
 - Graphviz
 - dia
 - Inkscape or png2pdf

To build the documentation run the following command in the root folder:
# doxygen docs/Doxyfile

This will place the resulting HTML documentation in docs/html.

Frequently Asked Questions
--------------------------

If you copy your source tree between machines beware that you may need to 
manually delete the following files and directories to fix your build..

# rm -r build
# rm -r .sconf_temp
# rm .sconsign.dblite
